            <h2>Architectural Designs</h2>
            <p>The term 'architect' has been used for many centuries, but the architect as a recognised profession is a relatively modern concept dating back to the mid 16th century, from the French architecte and Italian architetto (originating from the Greek arkhitekton, where arkhi means 'chief' and tekton 'builder'). The term and what it represents has evolved through history to its current form in which architects are seen as highly-qualified and educated professionals.</p>

            <h2>Exterior Designs</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, an efficient building envelope of a school keeps the exterior and interior environments separated. The envelope does so — through various means and components — by regulating moisture, air and temperatures, as well as outdoor light and noise levels inside the building. Those functions are of crucial importance not only to the efficiency and resilience of the building, but also to the quality of the environment for building users.</p>
